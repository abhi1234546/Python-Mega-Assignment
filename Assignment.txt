Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?

Ans-Differences between list and tuple is that list is mutable, whereas a tuple is immutable. 
    This means that lists can be changed, and tuples cannot be changed.

Ans-Sets in Python A set is an unordered and mutable collection of unique elements.

Q46. How can you create a set?

Ans-Creating Python Sets A set is created by placing all the items inside curly braces {},
    separated by comma, or by using the built-in set () function.

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

Ans-A set is a mutable object while frozenset provides an immutable implementation.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.

Ans-Union of two given sets is the set which contains all the elements of both the sets. 
    The union of two given sets A and B is a set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B such that no element is repeated.
    A = {12,45,78}
    B = {47,58,63}
 
   print("A U B:", A.union(B))

Ans-1)for loop,2)while loop,3)if-else loop,4)nested if-else loop

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?

Ans-For loops and while loops differ in their syntax. In while loops, we have to mention only the condition before starting the loop. 
    Whereas in the case of for loops, we have to mention the iterable as well as the sequence over which we iterate.

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?

Ans-Python continue statement is used to skip the execution of the current iteration of the loop.

Q72. What is the use of break statement?

Ans-The break statement in Python is used to get out of the current loop.

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?

Ans-pass is used when the user doesn’t want any code to execute. 
    So user can simply place pass where empty code is not allowed, like in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.

Q74. What is the use of range() function?

Ans- The range () function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, 
     and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

Ans-1)Looping Through Keys and Values A dictionary in Python contains key-value pairs. ...
    2)Converting a Dictionary Into a List Converting a dictionary into a list using iteration is as easy as transforming a list into a dictionary. ...
    3)Adding Up the Values in a Dictionary ...
